behavior_changes:
# *Changes that are expected to cause an incompatibility if applicable; deployment changes are likely required*

minor_behavior_changes:
# *Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*
- area: access_log
  change: |
    When emitting grpc logs, only downstream filter state was used. Now, both downstream and upstream filter states will be tried
    to find the keys configured in filter_state_objects_to_log.

bug_fixes:
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: buffer
  change: |
    Fixed a bug (https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/28760) that the internal listener causes an undefined
    behavior due to the unintended release of the buffer memory.
- area: http
  change: |
    Fixed recursion when HTTP connection is disconnected due to a high number of premature resets.
- area: grpc
  change: |
    Fixed a bug in gRPC async client cache which intermittently causes CPU spikes due to busy loop in timer expiration.
- area: tracing
  change: |
    Fixed a bug that caused the Datadog tracing extension to drop traces that
    should be kept on account of an extracted sampling decision.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: tls
  change: |
    added fallback :ref:`fallback
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.PrivateKeyProvider.fallback>`
    to support private key provider to fallback to boringssl tls handshake.
    If the private key provider isn't available (eg. the required hardware capability doesn't existed),
    Envoy will fallback to the BoringSSL default implementation when the fallback is true.
    The default value is false.
